# Firebase Import Error Fix - Complete Resolution

## âœ… **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Original Error:**
```
Cannot find module 'firebase/firestore' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

## ðŸ”§ **Root Cause Found**

The `firebase-enhanced.ts` file had severe structural issues:
- Duplicate method definitions
- Broken class structure with orphaned code
- Invalid syntax causing TypeScript compilation failures
- Extra closing brackets breaking the class definition

## ðŸ›  **Fix Applied**

1. **Replaced Corrupted File**: Used the clean `firebase-enhanced-clean.ts` as the source
2. **Fixed Import Path**: Corrected `import { db } from '../services/firebase'` to `import { db } from './firebase'`
3. **Validated Structure**: Ensured proper class structure and method definitions
4. **Removed Test Component**: Cleaned up temporary Firebase connection test component
